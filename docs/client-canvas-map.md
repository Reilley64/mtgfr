# Agent navigation — client canvas board

How agents find where battlefield paint, hits, flights, and DOM overlays live.
This is a **code map**, not a design system doc — tokens stay in [`DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md).

The client is a Foldkit SPA hosted on Nitro; the board is one submodel with three
surfaces (Canvas vector, Mount bitmap, HTML overlays). See the fine-grained board
specs for the current module split, especially
[board-composition](superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-board-composition.md),
[battlefield](superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-battlefield.md), and
[flights](superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-flights.md).

## How to find a concern

1. **Paint (pixels):** `client/app/board/canvas/scene.ts` builds the vector `BoardScene`; `felt.ts` / `avatars.ts` / `arrows.ts` are dumb paint helpers under `client/app/board/canvas/`.
2. **Bitmaps (card art):** `client/app/board/bitmap/mount.ts` — Foldkit `Mount` regions blit card faces + flights on top of the canvas via the shared `ImageCache`.
3. **Hits / camera:** `client/app/board/geometry/{camera,hit-test,density,layout,interaction}.ts` — pure geometry; used by the board submodel + `action/` planners.
4. **Flights:** `client/app/board/motion/flights.ts` — canvas-owned in-flight cards; resting hand/stack stay HTML.

   Flight animation is Mount-local rAF: mid-flight ticks paint only the flight
   canvas. Resting bitmap republishes when layout/chrome/hide sets change, not on
   every pose tick. Model receives `FlightsSynced` when the flying set changes.

5. **Board submodel:** `client/app/board/submodel.ts` composes canvas, bitmap, motion, action-session, and HTML overlays. `view.ts` is the composition root.
6. **HTML chrome:** `client/app/board/html/` — `stack.ts`, `turn-chrome.ts`, `priority-bar.ts`, `discoverability.ts`, `overlays.ts`, `hand.ts`, `mana-tray.ts`, `actions.ts`, `prompts.ts`, `activation-radial.ts`, `inspect.ts`.

## Module → responsibility map

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `app/board/geometry/camera.ts` | Camera SoT: `screen = world * zoom + pan` |
| `app/board/geometry/hit-test.ts` | Screen→world card/avatar hits (tapped/fan footprints) |
| `app/board/geometry/density.ts` | Row packing / hover-raise / clusters ([battlefield](superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-battlefield.md)) |
| `app/board/geometry/layout.ts` | Seat bands, card size, zone columns, attach layout |
| `app/board/geometry/interaction.ts` | Pointer FSM reducers + `fitCamera` |
| `app/board/geometry/combat-staging.ts` | Combat pointer resolution |
| `app/board/canvas/scene.ts` | Plain `BoardScene` builder + dumb `paintBoardScene` |
| `app/board/canvas/{felt,avatars,arrows}.ts` | Dumb canvas paint helpers |
| `app/board/bitmap/mount.ts` | Foldkit `Mount` regions for card faces |
| `app/board/bitmap/paint-cards.ts` / `paint-flights.ts` | Bitmap draw routines using `ImageCache` |
| `app/board/motion/flights.ts` | Flight spawn/step; `hideCardIds` / `flightOwnedIds` |
| `app/board/action/session.ts` | Play / target / combat staging session state |
| `app/board/action/{execution,targeting,modal,chrome}.ts` | Pure action planners |
| `app/board/submodel.ts` | Board `Model`/`update` composition |
| `app/board/view.ts` | Board composition root (canvas + Mount + HTML overlays) |
| `app/board/html/stack.ts` | Stack DOM (pile / strip / full) |
| `app/board/html/turn-chrome.ts` | Turn/priority chrome |
| `lib/image-cache.ts` | Art decode cache (shared canvas + bitmap) |
| `lib/wire/types.ts` | Wire shapes (snake_case) |

## Invariants (do not break)

1. **Hits use logical layout**, never tweened/`drawnCards` paint positions.
2. **Board layer stack (authoritative):** bottom → top paint/DOM order is fixed below. New board visuals must declare which layer they join; no ad-hoc `z-*` without updating this map.

   **Bottom → top:**

   Card/avatar paint order matches `mount.ts`: felt → seats → resting cards → avatars → arrows → flights.

   | # | Layer | Surface | Contents |
   |---|--------|---------|----------|
   | 1 | Felt / seats | Canvas vector | Table, seat bands |
   | 2 | Zone furniture | Canvas / world DOM | Library, command zone, **battlefield in-play mana** (left under your seat), GY, exile |
   | 3 | Resting battlefield permanents + avatars | Mount bitmap + Canvas vector (+ card chrome) | Battlefield faces paint first; avatar/life paint follows resting cards |
   | 4 | Arrows | Canvas | Committed attack/block, **declare-attackers drag aim**, spell aim — always above resting permanents |
   | 5 | Hand / stack / spell mana | HTML | Resting hand & stack; **spell/payment mana tray** (same layer as hand, above hand cards) |
   | 6 | Flights | Mount / motion | In-flight play cards — **above** hand and stack |
   | 7 | Combat / life hit targets | HTML | Interactive orbs when needed (paint stays in layer 2; hits here) |
   | 8 | Prompts / choice UI | HTML | `pending_choice` and related |
   | 9 | Turn HUD | HTML | Phase track, Next / End Turn, discoverability |
   | 10 | Inspect dock | HTML | Mode `dock` + backdrop — **topmost** |

   **Layer rules:**

   1. **Avatar paint** follows resting battlefield cards in layer 3; **clear bands** packing must not cover it. **Orb hits** stay in layer 7.
   2. **Two mana surfaces:** battlefield in-play mana (layer 2) vs spell/payment mana tray on the hand layer (5).
   3. No resting permanent paint or DOM card face may sit above layer 4 while combat/spell arrows are active. Declare-drag arrows use the **same arrow layer** as committed arrows.
   4. Flights paint above hand/stack (layer 6 over 5).
   5. Prompts (8) above combat/life hits (7).
   6. Inspect (10) above everything else on the board, including system modals, while pinned.
   7. Under-card name labels are forbidden on resting permanents (not a separate layer — deleted).

3. **Flight ownership:** while a flight owns an id, suppress duplicate HTML entrances and hide the resting face (`hideCardIds` / `flightOwnedIds`).
4. **Hand/stack rest as HTML;** battlefield + zone piles + flights are canvas/Mount. Do not merge into one scene graph.
5. **Canvas colors** are hex literals (see DESIGN.md); keep the legend swatches in sync when changing badge/outline colors.

## Non-goals

- No Pixi / Konva / fabric / WebGL rewrite from this map.
- No unified DOM+canvas retained graph — dual surface is intentional.
- Decision history lives in the feature specs; do not duplicate them here.
