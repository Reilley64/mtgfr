## Observability re-audit (falsified pool-absence claims)

Claims justified by pool absence that this deck falsifies — folded into the increments above:

1. `types/card.rs` "no pool Aura re-attaches" — **Prison Term** moves while attached (→ #156).
2. `types/card.rs` "no morph card is in the pool" — **Willbender**, **Illusionary Mask** (→ #163).
3. `cast.rs` cycling/hand activations resolved off-stack ("no pool card responds to a cycling
   activation") — **Azorius Guildmage** counters activated abilities; the deck ships five cycling
   cards (→ #146).
4. `effects.rs` "no pool card counters a flashback/escape spell" (countered flashback must exile,
   CR 702.34e) — **Hinder** + **Moment's Peace**/**Momentary Blink** (→ #160).
5. `types/effect.rs` `OpponentSplitsExilePiles` hardcodes next-in-APNAP opponent — **Fact or
   Fiction**'s controller chooses the opponent in multiplayer (→ #161).
6. `types/effect.rs` Chaos Warp's fused tuck ("split it only when a second card wants just the
   tuck half") — **Condemn**, **Temporal Spring**, **Hinder** (→ #135).

Near-misses that survive (no action): control-override timestamps (Rubinia + Confiscate pairing
still unreachable as until-EOT + aura), `discard_land` cost vs Compulsive Research's *effect*-time
choice, own-black-spell-vs-pro-black targeting (no black spells in this deck),
reanimation/blink counter-on-entry choke (no enters-with-counters static ships in this deck).
